{"name":"Bootstrap Installer","tagline":"A Bootstrap auto-installer for your webserver environment.","body":"### Welcome to Bootstrap Installer.\r\nBootstrap Installer is an auto-installer script that runs on your web server to create and publish a Bootstrap base to build off of. If you would like to initially test it out, feel free to clone the repository into your web root directory:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd web_folder/www\r\n$ mkdir bootstrap-installer\r\n$ cd bootstrap-installer\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/Oshizu/bootstrap-installer.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr you can use one of the buttons on the left to manually download or view the project.\r\n\r\n### What is Bootstrap Installer?\r\nAs mentioned above, Bootstrap Installer is an auto-installer for deploying the Bootstrap framework on your web environment. It is aimed at those who want to dive into Bootstrap with everything in place at the start, or developers who want everything to work right out-of-the-box. The installer will automatically generate PHP files ready to be used for widely-used components such as static headings across pages and MySQLi connectivity. All of this can be manually changed to fit your website's needs.\r\n\r\nBootstrap Installer comes shipped with a dynamic, responsive, and easy-to-use install script that will help guide you through a seamless install and configuration of Bootstrap.\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\nBootstrap Installer's only requirement is a web server (Apache or Nginx) with PHP version 5.3+.\r\n\r\nOptionally, you must also have a MySQLi-supported server for database connections. \r\n\r\n### How to install\r\nTo install and setup Bootstrap Installer, just download or clone the source and upload it to your web server's public folder. Then point your browser to _`http://yourdomain.com/install`_ and follow the instructions.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nNeed help or want to contribute? Head over to our Wiki and post Issues in the `master` (release) or `beta` branch of Bootstrap Installer!\r\n\r\nFeel free to also contact me over Twitter ([@oshizu_chan](https://twitter.com/oshizu_chan)).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
